# DevOps Study Guide: Deployment Strategies on AWS

## Introduction
In the world of DevOps, understanding how to deploy applications efficiently and reliably is crucial. AWS provides several services and strategies to help you manage deployments, ensuring high availability and minimal downtime. This guide will focus on a specific scenario involving an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer (ALB), highlighting a deployment strategy that satisfies the requirements laid out in your question.

## Core Concepts

### Amazon EC2
- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. It allows you to launch virtual servers, manage storage, and scale your applications.

### EC2 Auto Scaling
- **EC2 Auto Scaling** ensures you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle your application's load. It can automatically increase or decrease resources based on policies, schedules, or health checks.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **ALB** is designed to automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances. It operates at the Request Level (Layer 7), allowing it to make routing decisions based on content.

### Availability Zones
- **Availability Zones (AZs)** are physically separate locations within each AWS Region that are designed to be insulated from failures in other AZs. They offer the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.

## Deployment Strategy Requirements

The question asks for a deployment strategy that involves the following:
1. Launching a second fleet of EC2 instances with the same capacity as the original fleet.
2. Keeping the original fleet unchanged while the second fleet is launched.
3. Transitioning traffic to the second fleet once it is fully deployed.
4. Terminating the original fleet automatically 1 hour after the traffic transition.

## Recommended Solution: Blue/Green Deployment

**Blue/Green Deployment** is a strategy that meets all the specified requirements. Here's how it works in the context of the given scenario with AWS services:

1. **Initial Setup**: Maintain your current running instances (the "Blue" environment) behind an ALB.
2. **Launch a Second Fleet**: Create a new set of EC2 instances (the "Green" environment) with the same capacity as your original fleet. This is done without affecting the Blue environment, ensuring it remains unchanged and available.
3. **Routing Traffic**: Once the Green fleet is fully deployed and ready, update the ALB to start routing traffic to the Green fleet. This can be done by changing the target group in the ALB to point to the Green environment.
4. **Termination Policy**: After the traffic has been successfully shifted and the Green fleet is operational, set a policy to terminate the Blue fleet 1 hour after the cutover. This can be automated using AWS Lambda functions triggered by CloudWatch events or custom scripts.

## Advantages of Blue/Green Deployments

- **Minimal Downtime**: You can switch traffic between environments almost instantly, dramatically reducing downtime.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Since the original environment is kept intact until the new one is verified, rollback is simpler and quicker if issues arise.
- **Stable Testing Environment**: The Green environment can be used for final-stage testing under production-like conditions before going live.

## Tools and Services

To implement a Blue/Green Deployment strategy effectively, familiarize yourself with the following AWS services and tools:
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**: Understand how to manage and configure ALBs for traffic distribution.
- **AWS CloudFormation** or **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: These services can automate the creation of new environments, including EC2 instances, security groups, and load balancers.
- **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon CloudWatch**: Use these for automation, such as environment cleanup or scheduled tasks for resource management.

## Conclusion

This guide has introduced you to the core concepts and recommended solutions for deploying applications using EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling, ALB, and the Blue/Green deployment strategy on AWS. By understanding and applying these strategies, you can achieve efficient, reliable, and seamless application deployments in the AWS Cloud.

Happy learning and deploying!
