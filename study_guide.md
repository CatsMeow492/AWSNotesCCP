# Study Guide: Monitoring Security Group Changes for AWS EC2 Instances

## Understanding the Basics

### Amazon EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It allows users to run virtual servers, configure security and networking, and manage storage.

### Bastion Hosts
A bastion host is a server that sits at the perimeter of your network, acting as the primary access point for managing infrastructure, particularly in cloud environments. It is highly secured due to its exposed position to potential external threats.

### Security Groups in AWS
Security groups act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you set up a security group, you specify the ports, protocols, and source/destination IP ranges that are allowed to reach your instances.

## The Problem
You need to monitor and receive notifications when security group rules are modified, particularly to identify if SSH access (`TCP port 22`) has been allowed from any IP address (`0.0.0.0/0`), thereby potentially exposing the bastion hosts to unauthorized access.

## Solution Overview

1. **AWS CloudWatch Logs**: Collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events.
2. **AWS CloudTrail**: Provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service. CloudTrail events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs and APIs.
3. **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: A managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also called producers and consumers). SNS can be used to send notifications.
4. **AWS Lambda**: A compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically.

## Steps to Implement the Solution

### 1. Enabling CloudTrail Logging
- Ensure that AWS CloudTrail is enabled and configured to log API calls and related events within your AWS environment.
- The CloudTrail logs will capture any modifications made to your security groups.

### 2. Creating a CloudWatch Log Group and Filter
- Set up a CloudWatch Log Group to store the logs generated by CloudTrail.
- Create a CloudWatch Log Filter that identifies the specific event of modifying security group rules to allow SSH access from any IP address.

### 3. Setting Up a CloudWatch Alarm
- Use the filter pattern to match events where a security group is altered to allow `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH.
- When such an event is matched, configure the alarm to trigger an action.

### 4. Configuring an SNS Topic
- Create an SNS topic.
- Subscribe to the SNS topic using your email or another notification channel.

### 5. Integrating AWS Lambda (if necessary)
- For more complex notification logic or to perform automated remediation actions, use AWS Lambda.
- Trigger a Lambda function based on CloudWatch Alarm or directly on the CloudWatch Log Filter pattern match.
- The function can then programmatically send alerts or take corrective actions such as reverting the security group change.

## Key Concepts for Review

- **AWS CloudTrail**: Monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, providing a detailed audit trail.
- **AWS CloudWatch Logs and Alarms**: Offers monitoring, log collection, and alerting on specific log events or metrics.
- **Amazon SNS**: Facilitates the sending of notifications or alerts based on specified conditions or events.
- **Security Best Practices**: Always adhere to the principle of least privilege, especially when configuring access rules in security groups.
