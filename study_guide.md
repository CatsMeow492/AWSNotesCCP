# AWS Study Guide for Amazon SageMaker

## Question 6 Guide

### Problem:
Not being able to find the Amazon SageMaker notebook instance's EBS volume or Amazon EC2 instance within the VPC.

### Concepts:
- Amazon SageMaker notebook instances.
- EBS volumes and snapshots.
- EC2 instances visibility within a VPC.

### Steps to solve:
1. Understand that SageMaker notebook instances are managed service instances, where the underlying EC2 instances are not directly exposed to the user.
2. Recognize that SageMaker operates its infrastructure on your behalf, which abstracts away the underlying resources like EC2 instances.
3. Check the AWS documentation on how SageMaker manages notebook instances and EBS snapshots.

### Easy way to remember:
Remember that services like SageMaker abstract the underlying resources for simplicity and managed experience. In SageMaker, you deal with notebook instances at a higher level, unlike EC2 where you manage each instance directly, making the EC2 instances 'invisible' within your VPC from a user perspective.

## Question 4 Guide

### Problem:
Forecasting air quality (in parts per million of contaminates) for the next 2 days with only daily data from the last year.

### Concepts:
- Time series forecasting.
- Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms.
- Machine Learning models for forecasting.

### Steps to solve:
1. Understand the nature of the problem: time series forecasting requires analyzing past data to predict future values.
2. Research the built-in algorithms available in Amazon SageMaker suitable for time series forecasting. Given the scenario, look into algorithms like DeepAR+ for forecasting.
3. Compare the capabilities and requirements of each algorithm to decide which is most likely to suit the need for forecasting air quality based on available daily data.

### Easy way to remember:
When dealing with time series data in SageMaker, think "DeepAR+" as your go-to model for forecasting. It's designed for exactly this type of scenario where you are predicting future values based on past data and is well-suited for cases with daily observations.

Both answers aim to consolidate your understanding of specific AWS concepts in a concise manner, making it easy to recall and apply the knowledge to similar problems. Remember, checking the AWS documentation and understanding the managed nature of AWS services can hugely benefit in grasifying their functionalities and limitations.
